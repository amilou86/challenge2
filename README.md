# challenge-2

## Description
I have been tasked with craating a webpage portfolio of my work and skills as a student web developer.

To acheive this I have applied the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

### User Story
```
AS A student developer
I WANT a webpage to showcase my skills
SO THAT potential employers and clients can see what I can do and want to hire me
```
### Acceptance Criteria
When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
